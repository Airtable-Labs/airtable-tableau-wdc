# Airtable -> Tableau Web Data Connector

This [Tableau Web Data Connector](https://tableau.github.io/webdataconnector/) (WDC) uses the Airtable Metadata* and Base APIs to fetch a base's list of tables and fields (schema) as well as all records and make them available to Tableau for visualization.

The rest of this README is geared toward a technical audience.
